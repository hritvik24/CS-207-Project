# MG HECTOR AKA ELECTRA

Project Smartphone controlled car deals with the application of HC-05 Bluetooth Module,integrated chip i.e Motor driver, DC Motors & Ultrasonic Sensor.Credits goes to the Wrench that he made this project and showed on YOUTUBE where he Mentors viewers who wants to build a Smartphone Controlled Car using Bluetooth Module and Arduino where he gives command to arduino using an application.

There were modifications done in many different Sections of Project such as making car avoid obstacle using ultrasonic sensor and through LEDS,side signals are given according to the turn electra makes. Major elevation to the existing project is that electra runs on it own and if encouters any obstacle on its way, it will find its way and will move ahead in that direction.
